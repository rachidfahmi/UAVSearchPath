## Overview

This project implements a **Cell-DEVS model** of UAV search path planning on a **30×30 grid** using **Cadmium v2**.

Each cell stores two values:

| Field  | Type     | Meaning                      |
|--------|----------|------------------------------|
| `prob` | `double` | Target probability in [0, 1] |
| `uav`  | `int`    | `0` = empty, `100` = UAV     |

The two conceptual layers from the formal specification (UAV layer and probability layer) are merged into a **single cell state** to preserve Cell-DEVS locality and avoid explicit cross-layer coupling.

---

## Prerequisites

- Cadmium v2
- CMake 3.14 or newer
- `g++` with C++17 support

Cadmium header paths are configured in `CMakeLists.txt`.

---

## Build and Run

1. Build:

```bash
source build_sim.sh
```

2. Run full simulation:

```bash
./run.sh
```

Output is written to:

- `output/uav_log.csv`

---

## Visualizing Results

Open the Cell-DEVS Web Viewer and upload:

- `config/uav_config.json`
- `output/uav_log.csv`

### Viewer Requirements

- `origin` must be `[0, 0]` in the JSON file
- The JSON file must contain a `viewer` section with `prob` and `uav` layers
- Cell state must be printed as `prob,uav` with no spaces
- The CSV file must be semicolon-separated

---

## Experiments

| # | UAV Start | Hotspot | What to Observe |
|---|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | (0, 0) | (22, 22) | UAV follows the diffused gradient |
| 2 | (0, 0) | (22, 22) | Probability-only ring expands outward |

---

## Known Behavior

Near the target region, the UAV may oscillate between a small group of neighboring cells. This happens because:

- the probability field flattens due to diffusion
- the movement rule is purely local
- there is no stopping condition
- there is no revisit penalty

> **Tip:** This is an expected limitation of local hill-climbing on a dynamic field, not a bug.
